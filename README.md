# phoenix-client

This is my aproach to implement a purely functional Phoenix socket client in Clojure.

I'm basing on [fbonetti incredible elm implementation](https://github.com/fbonetti/elm-phoenix-socket)

## TODO
- [x] Find a nice websocket client library for Clojure.
- [x] Try [http-kit](https://github.com/http-kit/http-kit). Doesn't support websocket client.
- [x] Try [aleph](https://github.com/ztellman/aleph)
- [ ] Tests!!
  - [ ] See how other libs are testing their code.
  - [ ] What is the minimun test suite that assures the right behaviour? That is, it should be able to work as good as the official javascript client implementation.
- [ ] Refactor into a usable library
- [ ] Am I allowed to license this project as MIT???

## Usage
