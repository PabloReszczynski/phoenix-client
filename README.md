# phoenix-client

This is my aproach to implement a purely functional Phoenix socket client in Clojure.

I'm basing on [fbonetti incredible elm implementation](https://github.com/fbonetti/elm-phoenix-socket)

## TODO
- [ ] Find a nice websocket client library for Clojure.
- [x] Try [http-kit](https://github.com/http-kit/http-kit). Doesnt support websocket client.\
- [ ] Try [alpeh](https://github.com/ztellman/aleph)
- [ ] If all fails try [Java](https://github.com/TooTallNate/Java-WebSocket)
- [ ] Tests!!

## Usage
